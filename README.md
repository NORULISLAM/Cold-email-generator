# ðŸ“§ Cold Mail Generator

Cold email generator for services company using groq, langchain and streamlit. It allows users to input the URL of a company's careers page.

## Set-up

1. To get started we first need to get an API_KEY from here: https://console.groq.com/keys. Inside `app/.env` update the value of `GROQ_API_KEY` with the API_KEY you created.

2. To get started, first install the dependencies using:
   ```commandline
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the streamlit app:

   ```commandline
   streamlit run app/main.py

   ```

## Powershell activate and deactivate

```
  deactivate
venv\Scripts\activate

```
How It Now Works:

URL Analysis: Automatically extracts company name from job board URLs
Job Extraction: Gets actual job title, skills, and requirements
Auto-Update: Updates the role input field with the actual job title
Skill Matching: Maps required skills to your portfolio techstack
Dynamic Email: Generates personalized emails using actual job data
Multiple Jobs: Handles multiple job postings with different personalized emails



The system will now:

Auto-detect "Zeals" as the company name
Extract the actual job role (e.g., "AIãƒ»æ©Ÿæ¢°å­¦ç¿’ã‚¨ãƒ³ã‚¸ãƒ‹ã‚¢")
Use this role throughout the email instead of the default "AI/ML Engineer"
Reference the specific skills mentioned in the job posting
Create a truly personalized email for that specific role
